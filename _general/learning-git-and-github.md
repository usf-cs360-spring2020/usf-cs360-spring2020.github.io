If you do not yet have a free Github account, you need to create one:

<https://github.com/join>

When creating an account for this class (including accounts already created), keep in mind:

- Choose a professional username.

- Add information to your profile, including a brief bio with your degree and expected graduation date at a minimum.

- Add a professional profile photo. See this [blog post](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2014/12/5-tips-for-picking-the-right-linkedin-profile-picture) for tips. If you need a photo, I have a decent camera in my office.

You can see the [instructor's profile page](https://github.com/sjengle) for an example. When done with this class, you'll be able to show off your Github profile to potential employers.
